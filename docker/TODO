orig image -> no hair image -> croped image DONE
1. no_hair
2. counter extract or crop by aprox rectangle
!try without imagenet weights DONE BAD

create more data with marked 1, try different sizes
extract square with nevus DONE

try efficiencynet, resnet 152 DONE

improve by focus image
exclude duplicates
improve by learn on different image sizes
improve by removing hair DONE
make gray?
add other features, aggregated result from several models

2x scale for videos with less than 300 pixels wider side
no rescale for videos with wider side between 300 and 1000
0.5x scale for videos with wider side > 1000 pixels
0.33x scale for videos with wider side > 1900 pixels
learn model by parts but with better image quality
