Add normalization


1. Add new examples, 512 https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/discussion/169139 https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000 https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/isic-2019
2. Add custom layer https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.3.0/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/preprocessing/image_preprocessing.py#L349-L424  with augmentation

##FLOW
1. create pos images in /home/werdn/input/jpeg/tsds/train/malignant
/home/werdn/input/jpeg/tsds/test/malignant  create_pos_images3.py
2. split by train and test in /home/werdn/input/jpeg/tsds split_images.py
3. run learn



load dataset http://tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/ImageFolder
use b3 300 https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_efficientnet_fine_tuning/
merge with csv model


50/50 samples
Black and white


#######SCENARIO###########

#######SCENARIO########### DONE


orig image -> no hair image -> croped image DONE
1. no_hair
2. counter extract or crop by aprox rectangle
!try without imagenet weights DONE BAD

512
remove hair
additional params model


create simple model +
ImageDataGenerator
efficiencynet https://www.kaggle.com/arjunrao2000/beginners-guide-efficientnet-with-keras
create more data with marked 1, try different sizes
extract square with nevus DONE

try efficiencynet, resnet 152 DONE

improve by focus image
exclude duplicates
improve by learn on different image sizes
improve by removing hair DONE
make gray?
add other features, aggregated result from several models

2x scale for videos with less than 300 pixels wider side
no rescale for videos with wider side between 300 and 1000
0.5x scale for videos with wider side > 1000 pixels
0.33x scale for videos with wider side > 1900 pixels
learn model by parts but with better image quality
